# Miv

Miv is simple javascript game made with nodejs. Later, I will open a server to play among us.

## Test

* Download the repository
* On your terminal, run:

```sh
node server.js
```

* On your browser, go to:

```sh
localhost:8080
```

* Let me know what don't you like and/or how to improve it
