# Miv

Miv is simple **javascript game** made with nodejs. Later, I'll open a server to play among us.

### To test

You need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) to test it. Nodejs includes **node** and **npm** binaries 

1. Download the repository

2. Move to root path of the project

3. Install dependencies:
	
	```sh
	npm install
	```

4. Type in a terminal:

	```sh
	node server.js
	```

5. In a browser, go to "localhost:5000"

6. Test it

7. And let me know how to improve it
